Convolution: Convolution is an information aggregation process by reducing noise. This is accomplished by applying a filter over an input.
Filter/Kernel: An operator (a matrix of inputs) applied over an input to generate features (patterns)
Epochs: If an entire dataset is passed once through a neural network it is called as an epoch
1x1 Convolution: A 1x1 matrix ( 1 number) is convoluted over an max pooled image in order to reduce the Z dimension.
3x3 Convolution: A 3x3 matrix of kernel that is convoluted over an image is called as 3x3 convolution.
Feature Maps: The output obtained after applying a kernel/filter over an input is feature maps. In general, the features extracted through one or more layers of convolution

Activation Function: An activation function decided whether the input (summation of weighted sum of inputs and bias) from a node to be fired or not.
Receptive Field: It is defined as the region in the input space that a particular CNNâ€™s feature is looking at after one or more layers of convolution.
